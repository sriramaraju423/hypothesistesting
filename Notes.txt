Alpha mistake is when we take action
beta mistake is do not take action.
p>alpha null hypothesis
p<alpha alternative hypothesis
Memory tip:
p high null fly i.e. Fail to reject h0
p low null go i.e. let h0 go, whcih means reject h0

One of the best transformation technique is 'Log transformation'.
Generally '=' will always go to null hypothesis

Imp takeaway: Where ever there is null hypothesis there is 'assumption'.
So instead of normal conclusion of H0 we are always say assumption. Refer 'Hypothesis testing - Example in deck'
